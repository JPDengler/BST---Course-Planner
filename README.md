# Reflection on Course Planner Project

## Problem Statement

In the projects for this course, I aimed to create a Course Planner program to manage and retrieve information about courses efficiently. The main challenge was to design a system that could handle course data, including course numbers, titles, and prerequisites, and provide users with the ability to search, display, and organize this information effectively.

## Approach and Importance of Data Structures

To address this problem, I approached it by leveraging data structures, specifically a binary search tree (BST). Data structures are vital in software development as they provide a systematic way to organize and store data, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation. In this project, I utilized a BST to enable rapid search, sorting, and traversal of the course data. Understanding data structures is crucial because they form the foundation of efficient algorithms and optimized software systems.

## Overcoming Roadblocks

Throughout the project, I encountered challenges in parsing course data from files, managing memory efficiently, and ensuring accurate traversal of the BST. To overcome these roadblocks, I made use of C++'s standard libraries, carefully managed memory allocation and deallocation, and rigorously tested the program with various inputs. Additionally, I sought guidance from online resources and debugging techniques to pinpoint and resolve issues.

## Evolution of Software Design

Working on this project significantly expanded my approach to designing software. I learned the importance of modularization, where breaking down the code into smaller, well-defined functions enhances readability and maintainability. Separating tasks like file handling, data parsing, and UI interaction into distinct functions improved code organization and debugging. This project taught me to think critically about program structure, making it more modular, flexible, and easier to extend in the future.

## Improving Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

The course planner project has evolved my programming practices by emphasizing the significance of maintainability, readability, and adaptability. Through the iterative development process, I realized that writing clear and concise code not only makes it easier for others to understand but also simplifies future updates and modifications. Implementing meaningful function and variable names, along with comments, promotes code comprehension. Moreover, by following best practices like encapsulation and separation of concerns, I've built a more adaptable codebase that can accommodate changes without causing cascading effects.

In conclusion, the Course Planner project provided a practical platform to apply data structures, enhance software design skills, and learn the value of maintainable and adaptable code. This experience not only solidified my understanding of programming concepts but also equipped me with essential techniques for crafting efficient, readable, and resilient software solutions.
